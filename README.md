## 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate backend developer specializing in PHP, Java, and MySQL.  
I enjoy building secure, database-driven web applications with proper authentication and CRUD functionality.

I developed a Geo-Location based QR Code Attendance System with 100-meter validation to prevent proxy attendance.

Currently looking for Internship / Entry-Level opportunities in Web Development or Backend Development.
